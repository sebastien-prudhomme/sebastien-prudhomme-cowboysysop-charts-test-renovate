## Quality

All these charts are tested with [ct](https://github.com/helm/chart-testing) on multiple Kubernetes versions, from v1.16 to v1.22, with the help of [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/).

## Contributing

As this is a personal project, as I want to keep some consistency between these charts and as I don't have enough time to write down the best practices I use, I'm not accepting any pull requests.

However, I'll be happy to add some new features to these charts, so don't hesitate to open issues to submit your needs.
